# To run the project

*This is a minimal version of the project, not everything is working. Features enabled: map updates, graphs. Features NOT enabled: donation graph updates.*

* This is tested on a Mac. It should work well on Linux. It most likely won't run on Windows.
* First, clone/download this repository. In the terminal, navigate to the folder of the repo. 
* Use python 3.5. The mlpd3 library won't work on python 3.6. This library creates matplotlib plots in html.
* To run use `python3.5 crisis-awareness.py` in the folder that contains the `crisis-awareness.py` file.
* Intall every library that is needed (it will throw an error message if there's a missing library)

If that works you're been lucky! Now:

* Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and explore the app.
* Do NOT click on Update donation plot before clicking on update, it will break (I didn't enable that functionality)
* If anything breaks (basically a white screen with error messages), click on Ctrl-C in the python terminal and relaunch.
* Explore the code to use for your app!

Note: Be patient with the app. If it's slow, don't click on a bunch of buttons, it will break. Just wait a bit!

# About the project: Conflict Awareness	
		
Conflict	 Awareness	 was	 created	 with	 the	 view	 of	 aggregating	 data	 from	 multiple	 sources	 in	 an	 attempt	 to	
have	a	better	understanding	of	conflict	dynamics.	More	specifically,	an	implicit	objective	for	this	project	was	
to	shed	light	on	the	impact	of	foreign	military	interventions	on	different	conflicts.	
	
A	lot	of	attention	was	given	to	this	topic,	J.	Pickering	argued	that	foreign	interventions	do	not	usually	leave	a	
significant	 and	 long	 lasting	 impact	 on	 economic	 growth	 and	 quality	 of	 life	 unless	 they	 occur	 in	 nondemocratic	
states	 (J.	 Pickering,	 2006)	 and	 he	 also	 assessed	 the	 impact	 of	 war	 length	 on	 various	 factors	 (J.	
Pickering,	 2015).	 Molfino,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 assessed	 the	 role	 of	 foreign	 donations	 and	 the	 potentially	
violence	aggravating	impact	it	may	have	(Molfino,	2016).	Opinions	are	divided	on	the	effectiveness	of	foreign	
interventions	 and	 aids,	 although	 most	 researchers	 agree	 on	 the	 influence	 of	 the	 context	 of	 such	
interventions,	and	particularly	that	of	the	regime	type.	
	
Conflict	 Awareness	 aims	 to	 complement	 existing	 academic	 research	 by	 providing	 an	 easily	 accessible	
visualisation	interface	for	two	major	and	relatively	recent	conflicts:	the	War	in	Afghanistan	and	the	Civil	War	
in	 Central	 African	 Republic.	 While	 these	 two	 conflicts	 are	 substantially	 different	 in	 their	 nature,	 they	 both	
involved	 large-scale	 foreign	 military	 interventions	 on	 non-democratic	 states.	 Conflict	 Awareness	 was	
designed	to	focus	on	three	pillars:	Violence,	Quality	of	Life	&	Development	and	Public	Opinion.
