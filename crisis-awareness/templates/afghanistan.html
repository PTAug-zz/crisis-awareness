                        <h3>Summary of the conflict</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Afghanistan war is an international conflict in
                            Afghanistan beginning in 2001 that was triggered by
                            the September 11 attacks and consisted of three
                            phases.
                            The first phase—toppling the Taliban (the
                            ultraconservative political and religious faction
                            that ruled Afghanistan and provided sanctuary for
                            al-Qaeda,
                            perpetrators of the September 11 attacks)—was
                            brief, lasting just two months. The second phase,
                            from 2002 until 2008, was marked by a U.S.
                            strategy of defeating the Taliban militarily and
                            rebuilding core institutions of the Afghan state.
                            The third phase, a turn to classic
                            counterinsurgency doctrine,
                            began in 2008 and accelerated with U.S. Pres.
                            Barack Obama’s 2009 decision to temporarily
                            increase the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan.
                            The larger force was used to implement a strategy
                            of protecting the population from Taliban attacks
                            and supporting efforts to reintegrate insurgents
                            into Afghan society.
                            The strategy came coupled with a timetable for the
                            withdrawal of the foreign forces from Afghanistan;
                            beginning in 2011, security responsibilities would
                            be gradually
                            handed over to the Afghan military and police. The
                            new approach largely failed to achieve its aims.
                            Insurgent attacks and civilian casualties remained
                            stubbornly high,
                            while many of the Afghan military and police units
                            taking over security duties appeared to be
                            ill-prepared to hold off the Taliban.
                            By the time the U.S. and NATO combat mission
                            formally ended in December 2014, the 13-year
                            Afghanistan War had become the longest war ever
                            fought by the United States.
